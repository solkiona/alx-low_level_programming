This program implements the singly linked list in C. A singly linked list is a data structure used to store a sequence of elements, called nodes, in which each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head and the last node is called the tail, and the tail's next pointer is set to NULL to indicate the end of the list.
