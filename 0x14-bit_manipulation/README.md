#Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating individual bits in a binary number. This is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in many applications, such as cryptography, compression, and low-level programming.

Bit manipulation can be performed using bitwise operators, which operate on the individual bits of a number. The most common bitwise operators are:

& (bitwise AND) \n
| (bitwise OR) \n
^ (bitwise XOR) \n
~ (bitwise NOT) \n
<< (left shift) \n

Using these operators, it is possible to perform operations such as setting, clearing, toggling, and testing individual bits in a number.
